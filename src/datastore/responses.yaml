    Welcome young journeyer! You’ve found my first quest!
    As it so happens I’m on the hunt for a nest! My whanau are a bit
    crowded over in Zealandia and this park seems like a great place to start a family! 
    BUT, there are a few things I need to know before I’m sure it’s safe for my chicks.
    If you wouldn’t mind, could you give me a hand to work that out?

    Unfortunately the park is infested with rats! \n
    And a kākā has made a nest somewhere in the park \n
    Your mission is to find and bait the traps before the rats find the kākā nest.

    I am  attempting to make its home in this park but the park has rats!
    Your goal is to discover and destroy the rat’s nest and protect my chicks!
    The rats nest is located at one of the 12 habitats throughout the park.
    Each habitat has a sign that looks like this.
